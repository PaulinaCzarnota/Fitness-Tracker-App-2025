/**
 * Goal Extensions for enhanced completion logic
 *
 * This file provides extension functions for the Goal entity that implement
 * sophisticated completion logic for different goal types. The extensions
 * handle edge cases including overachievement, negative values, and
 * goal-type specific completion criteria.
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Type-specific completion logic for distance, calorie, and step goals
 * - Overachievement detection and handling
 * - Negative value protection
 * - Edge case handling for various goal scenarios
 * - Performance optimized calculations

 * Enhanced completion check that handles goal-type specific logic

 * - Calorie goals: Handles both burn and intake scenarios
 * - Step goals: Accounts for step count variations and accuracy
 * - Other goals: Uses standard target/current value comparison
 *
 * @return true if the goal is completed according to its type-specific criteria
