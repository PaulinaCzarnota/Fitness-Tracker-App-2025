/**
 * Comprehensive Test Suite for Goal Extensions
 *
 * This test file provides thorough coverage of the enhanced goal completion logic,
 * including edge cases for overachievement, negative values, and goal-type specific
 * completion criteria. Tests cover distance, calorie, and step goal types with
 * various scenarios to ensure robust functionality.
 *
 * Test Categories:
 * - Basic completion logic for all goal types
 * - Distance goal completion with GPS tolerance
 * - Calorie goal completion for different scenarios
 * - Step goal completion with device variation tolerance
 * - Edge case handling (negative values, zero targets, overachievement)
 * - Progress calculation accuracy
 * - Completion status consistency
